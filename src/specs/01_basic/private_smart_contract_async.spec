 Tags: basic, async

Ability to submit a simple private smart contract asynchrously with callback
```
pragma solidity ^0.5.17;

contract SimpleStorage {
    uint private storedData;

    constructor(uint initVal) public {
        storedData = initVal;
    }

    function set(uint x) public {
        storedData = x;
    }

    function get() public constant returns (uint retVal) {
        return storedData;
    }
}
```

## Contract is successfully mined with valid account

* Asynchronously deploy a simple smart contract with initial value "10" in "Node1"'s default account and it's private for "Node4", named this contract as "contract17"
* Transaction Receipt is present in "Node1" for "contract17" from "Node1"'s default account
* Transaction Receipt is present in "Node4" for "contract17" from "Node1"'s default account

## Contract is not mined with non-existed account

* Asynchronously deploy a simple smart contract with initial value "20" in "Node1"'s non-existed account and it's private for "Node4", named this contract as "contract17_error"
* An error is returned for "contract17_error"
