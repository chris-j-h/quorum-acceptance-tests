The following smart contracts are used:

__storec.sol__
```
contract storec {
    uint private storedValue;

    constructor (uint pval) public {
        storedValue = pval;
    }

    function setc(uint x) public {
        storedValue = x;
    }

    function getc() public view returns (uint) {
        return storedValue;
    }
}
```

__storeb.sol__
```
interface storec {
    function setc(uint x) external;

    function getc() external view returns (uint);
}

contract storeb {
    uint private storedValue;
    storec anotherStorage;

    constructor (uint initVal, address _addrc) public {
        storedValue = initVal;
        anotherStorage = storec(_addrc);
    }

    function getc() public view returns (uint) {
        return anotherStorage.getc();
    }

    function getb() public view returns (uint) {
        return storedValue;
    }

    function setc(uint x) public {
        return anotherStorage.setc(x);
    }

    function setb(uint x) public {
        uint mc = anotherStorage.getc();
        storedValue = x * mc;
    }
}
```

__storea.sol__
```
interface storeb {
    function setb(uint x) external;

    function setc(uint x) external;

    function getb() external view returns (uint);

    function getc() external view returns (uint);
}

contract storea {
    uint private storedValue;
    storeb anotherStorage;

    constructor (uint initVal, address _addrb) public {
        storedValue = initVal;
        anotherStorage = storeb(_addrb);
    }

    function geta() public view returns (uint) {
        return storedValue;
    }

    function getb() public view returns (uint) {
        return anotherStorage.getb();
    }

    function getc() public view returns (uint) {
        return anotherStorage.getc();
    }

    function seta(uint x) public {
        uint mc = anotherStorage.getb();
        storedValue = x * mc;
    }

    function setb(uint x) public {
        anotherStorage.setb(x);
    }

    function setc(uint x) public {
        anotherStorage.setc(x);
    }
}
```
